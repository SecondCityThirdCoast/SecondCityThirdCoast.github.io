                <p class="display-4" >Hi! <br/> You have been enrolled in an automated alert system checking for appointment availabilty through the Cook County Department of Public Health's website. A program is currently running on a server and checking for appointment availability several times per minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <p class="display-4 bg-light border">If the program detects possible first-dose appointment availability, you will receive a text message alerting you to check the site. It is possible that the County could alter the site in such a way that false positives may be detected or availability could be missed.  I will be checking regularly to detect these changes and update the program as necessary.</p>
