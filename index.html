                <p class="display-4 bg-light border">Please note - this is an unofficial alert system checking for COVID-19 vaccination appointments through various public and private providers.  By being enrolled in this program, you will get alerts when appointments <em>may be available to be booked.</em> This program <u>does not book appointments</u> you must still go to the provider and book your appointment.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <p class="display-4 bg-light border">If the program detects possible first-dose appointment availability, you will receive a text message alerting you to check the site.  <em>Appointments are booked very quickly and may only be available for a few minutes.</em><br>It is possible that the County could alter the site in such a way that false positives may be detected or availability could be missed.  I will be checking regularly to detect these changes and update the program as necessary.</p>
